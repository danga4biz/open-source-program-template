summary: loss of trust and confidence due to lack of interoperability and inability of providers to relief clients
---

For many years the main obstacles and impediments to the uptake of e-procurement, e-business and e-invoicing were divergent legislation and technical complexity. Although the European Commission devoted much effort to increase legal certainty and reduce technical complexity, companies are still reluctant to implement. Many decision-makers are concerned about the multiplicity of solutions available on the market, the cost of implementation and the number of business partners that can be connected. But most of all, they are overwhelmed by the data and process integration complexity.

Despite all standardization initiatives - this complexity is increasing, mainly due to: 
- the growing number of platforms and networks which are not interoperable

- the existence and growth of more non-interoperable proprietary and national standards

- ERP systems that do not have a standardized process-aware interface

In my view - the lack of interoperability across the multitude of networks and the inability of providers to fully relieve clients from the complexity of implementation are to be regarded the main reasons for the loss of trust and confidence.

The main challenges to fight complexity are: more openness and insight; and more safeguards and guarantees for implementers.
